## Testing npm

To run unit tests:

    $ ./bin/test release    # release testing, also creates required __testApp
    $ ./bin/test fast       # skip time consuming tests
    $ ./bin/test            # full test suite, skip setup (release)
    $ ./bin/test path/to/spec.coffee

## Contributing

We gladly accept pull requests! However, include only one feature or fix per one pull request.
That way, it will be much easier to review and merge each one contribution.

To develop Steroids-npm locally:

* Clone this repo and install its dependencies (`npm install`).
* Create a symlink from `/usr/local/bin/devroids` to your development Steroids executable.
* Use `devroids` as you would use `steroids`.
